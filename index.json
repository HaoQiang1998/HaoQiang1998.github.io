Task offloading from mobile devices to the cloud is more and more frequent. Edge Computing, deploying relatively small-scale edge servers close to users, is a promising cloud computing paradigm to reduce the network communication delay. Due to the limited capability, each edge server can be configured with only a small amount of functions to run corresponding tasks. Moreover, a mobile application might consist of multiple dependent tasks, which can be modeled and scheduled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). When an application request arrives online, typically with a deadline specified, we need to configure the edge servers and assign the dependent tasks for processing. In this work, we jointly tackle on-demand function configuration on edge servers and DAG scheduling to meet as many request deadlines as possible. Based on list scheduling methodologies, we propose a novel online algorithm, named OnDoc, which is efficient and easy to deploy in practice. Extensive simulations on the data trace from Alibaba (including more than 3 million application requests) demonstrate that OnDoc outperforms state-of-the-art baselines consistently on various experiment settings.","tags":["Online Scheduling","Edge Computing"],"title":"Online DAG Scheduling with On-demand Function Configuration in Edge Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chi Zhang","Haisheng Tan","Haoqiang Huang","etc. Submitted"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4830f1c4a484e94430cb8af632754f20","permalink":"/publication/publication-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publication-2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Online Dispatching and Scheduling of Jobs with Heterogeneous Utilities in Edge Computing","type":"publication"}]
