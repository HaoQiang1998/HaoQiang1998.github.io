Task offloading from mobile devices to the cloud is more and more frequent. Edge Computing, deploying relatively small-scale edge servers close to users, is a promising cloud computing paradigm to reduce the network communication delay. Due to the limited capability, each edge server can be configured with only a small amount of functions to run corresponding tasks. Moreover, a mobile application might consist of multiple dependent tasks, which can be modeled and scheduled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). When an application request arrives online, typically with a deadline specified, we need to configure the edge servers and assign the dependent tasks for processing. In this work, we jointly tackle on-demand function configuration on edge servers and DAG scheduling to meet as many request deadlines as possible. Based on list scheduling methodologies, we propose a novel online algorithm, named OnDoc, which is efficient and easy to deploy in practice. Extensive simulations on the data trace from Alibaba (including more than 3 million application requests) demonstrate that OnDoc outperforms state-of-the-art baselines consistently on various experiment settings.","tags":["Online Scheduling","Edge Computing"],"title":"Online DAG Scheduling with On-demand Function Configuration in Edge Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Zihe Wang","Jie Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"Probabilistic Serial rule is a one of the most prominent randomized allocation rules.
